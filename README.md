# Amplify JavaScript Sample Applications

This repository contains samples intended to demonstrate how to use the different [Amplify Categories](https://docs.amplify.aws/) in your application. These samples are listed by framework below and can be run locally to understand how they work end to end.

At a minimum, to get started, you will need an [AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start). Each repository has its own set of instructions to get you started.
